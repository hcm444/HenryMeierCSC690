# HenryMeierCSC690
Final Project
This is my Tic Tac Toe final project for CSC 690

I spend maybe 10 hours building this code and checking errors.
Optionals are a big pain, and I don't want to implement them. Therefore, different labels display 4 game conditions.
There are two arrays, one for the game state for turns 1-9
One for all win conditions
Buttons on the imageview board just change picture conditions based on player turn.
These buttons are AnyObject linked to the main class.
